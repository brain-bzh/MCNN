# MCNN

Matching Convolutional Neural Networks Without Priors About Data

## Paper

[short version under review at ICLR 2018 Workshop](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ9e4HJPM)

[long version (coming soon)](https://)

## Graph Processing

Graph generation and translation searching available in folder graph_processing. Instructions coming soon.

## CIFAR-10

Code for our method is available at folder pytorch, but it is messy. Instructions for execution, clean code and code for the defferard method coming soon.

## PINES/IAPS

Code needs cleaning and will be available soon.

Architecture (CNN, Defferard and Proposed): Input Layer -> Dropout (0.1) -> Conv(1->64) -> Conv(64->128) -> Dropout(0.1) -> Linear(128*369 -> 2)

## Visualizations

Coming soon
